screen-grab
===========

For the version tuned for playing the lightning dodging minigame in Final Fantasy X, see [the lightning-dodger](https://github.com/Jimbly/screen-grab/tree/lightning_dodger) branch.

Utility functions for grabbing the screen and moving the mouse (automation) on Linux, for eventual use in [Jimbly's VeggieTales](http://www.bigscreensmallgames.com/VeggieTales/) (Windows automation tool)

Some code initially gleaned from [boblight](https://code.google.com/p/boblight/).
